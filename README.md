# Object-Oriented Programming with PHP primer.

Here we have 4 miniapps created in a training with the marvelous trainers Lorna Jane Mitchell and Emma Jane Hogbin. This was a great workshop for re-learning OOP in PHP in preparation for Drupal 8's OO patterns utilizing Symphony2.

This is mostly a reference notebook for me so i remember how OOP works in PHP. But its possible they might be useful to you for your own OO Primer. 

## Intallation & Usage

Simply place this whole project in a directory that your LAMP stack can access in a web browser, and visit the root.
